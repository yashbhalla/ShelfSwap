# 📚 ShelfSwap: Book Trading and Sharing Platform

Welcome to the **ShelfSwap: Book Trading and Sharing Platform** repository! This project is designed to help users trade and lend books in their local area. The platform aims to connect book lovers, promote sustainable sharing, and foster a community of avid readers.  

## 🌟 Project Overview

This platform allows users to:
- List books they own and mark them as available for trade or borrowing.
- Browse and search for books based on title, author, genre, or location.
- Request trades or borrow books from other users.
- Manage their book inventory and track their activity logs.

The project focuses heavily on backend development, REST API creation, and database interactions. A minimal frontend using **Swagger/OpenAPI** will be utilized for API testing during development, but an optional Angular-based frontend can be added for enhanced user interaction.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### **Backend**
- **C# with ASP.NET Core:** For building a robust and scalable REST API.
- **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication with role-based access control (user, admin).

### **Database**
- **PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQLite:** For storing user data, book listings, requests, and activity logs.  
  *(SQLite for simplicity during development; PostgreSQL/MySQL for production use.)*

### **Deployment**
- **Docker:** Containerization for consistent and portable deployment.
- **Kubernetes (optional):** For orchestration and scalability.

### **Frontend (Optional)**
- **Angular:** For creating an interactive user interface.
- **Swagger/OpenAPI:** For API testing during development.
